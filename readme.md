# Blogify

A React 16 project application which is simply a blogging app which allows you to login through various social media accounts, or alternatively search through other peoples posts.

It's a work in progress, and was built solely to test my React and Redux capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- React 16
- Redux
- React-Redux
- React-Router-Dom
- Babel
- SASS
- Quill.js & React-Quill
- React-Dates
- Redux-Thunk
- WebPack
- React-Modal
- Highlight.js

## Deployment

Heroku was used for this stage of deployment for the website, as it's free and can easily be upgraded should it become necessary to do so.

## Database

The database that I used was Firebase as it offers a free option and is sufficient to fulfill all needs for the application. It also gave the option to link social media accounts as a login technique.

## Tests

Test were made using Jest & Enzyme.
